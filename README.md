# Automation testing wiht python - learning
I decided to learn basics of **automation testing**. I am using various tutorials.

File structure
´´´
- **Program**: files with simple functions (I am then testing these functions)
- **Tests**
  - **Unit**: I am learning especially unit testing
  - **Integration**: I created this folder just to try file tructure of real tests
   - **Fixutures**: I don't have any (I created these files just to learn, that I should use .json etc.)
